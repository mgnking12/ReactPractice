// 'class App' is declaring a component using React ES6 class component, after you have declared a component, you can use it as an element anywhere in your application by creating an instance of it ex: <App />  ///////// we are then extending the Component class that we are importing above from React
class App extends Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      list,
      searchTerm: ''
    };
    // In order to define the onDismiss() as class method, you have to bind it in the constructor which we are doing below, We could also bind it in the button instead of the constructor, but we avoid this because that would cause it to bind everytime the button is clicked. We also avoid writing out the business logic for the onDissmiss function in the constructor so it won't "clutter up" the constructor, the constructor is onlythere to instantiate your class with all its properties. Class methods can be auto-bound using JavaScript ES6 arrow functions by themselves, but lets stick with the constructor method for now since that is what it says in the react docs. 
    this.onDismiss = this.onDismiss.bind(this);

    this.onSearchChange = this.onSearchChange.bind(this);
  }

  onDismiss(id){
  const notId = item => item.objectID !== id;
  // The filter function returns a new list instead of mutating the old one, and it supports the React convention of using immutable data structures.
  const updatedList = this.state.list.filter(notId);
  this.setState({ list: updatedList });
  }

  // When using a handler in your element, you get access to the synthetic React event in your callback functionâ€™s signature.
  onSearchChange(event){
    this.setState({ searchTerm: event.target.value });
  }

  render() {
    const { searchTerm, list } = this.state; //Destructuring in JavaScript ES6 provides easier access to properties in objects and arrays, this way we don't have to keep typing this.state when we access searchTerm and list from here on out!
